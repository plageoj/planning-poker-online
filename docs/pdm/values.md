# Planning Poker System - User Value Document

## Executive Summary

Our Planning Poker system transforms sprint planning from a manual, disconnected process into a streamlined, automated workflow. By integrating real-time estimation with Backlog API, we eliminate manual CSV operations and provide engineering-driven Scrum Masters with the tools they need to focus on facilitation rather than administrative overhead.
